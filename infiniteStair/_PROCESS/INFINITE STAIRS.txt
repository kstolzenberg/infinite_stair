INFINITE STAIRS

beware of .js tutorials

PSEUDO CODE
- create a cube object at a mouse location
- get the distance between two cube objects in terms of x,y,z offsets
- loop over that distance to create new cubes == steps
- be able to walk and explore
    ? how to add corner landings? 
        - check for x, y positions - if not the same, find the where x1, y2 is.
        - somes sort of rotation?
    ? do you do this perfectly symmetrically? two landings at a time?

base case:
- draw two landings in same x/y plane. only z is different.
- get the distance between the two object
- loop over distance to build steps

next:
- print and inspect the positions
- move the landings to be out of plane
- last - accept any location.

TODAY
-try new GO on mouse click at mouse click
-Try to google a stair. 
-Otherwise take off offsets and tread width = ydelta / zdelta, try new parent thing
